John: Rose, my Uncle Dave is dead!
Rose: Oh no! What happened?
John: I don't know. I went visit him just now and his place is surrounded by cops and he's dead.
Rose: I'm so sorry John.
John: I wish I had been there to protect him last night, but I had plans...
Rose: ...
John: Wait! Where did you say you were last night?
Rose: Something came up.
John: What 'something'?
Rose: Are you accusing me of hurting your Uncle Dave?
John: {No, I just want to know.}{Well, where were you?}
Rose: I was at Julie's.
John: At Julie's!?! I thought you hated augmentation?
Rose: Well...I...I have to go.
