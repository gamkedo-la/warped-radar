# Warped Radar Lore

Society:  
Takes place in the city of Ohm*
Despite technology being significantly evolved, Ohm is still considered as a “developing” society (in the future, it’s used in a technological sense)
Outward appearance/quality of the buildings = old looking, but actual structure and build show that they’re from the future. 
We don’t know how much more advanced other cities are, so technology shown in Ohm can be as futuristic as you’d like, as long as it obeys the first sub-point above.
Street culture has been prevalent despite technological advancement and thus influences the type of fashion the people prefer to wear (examples of street culture: street art, street dance/hip hop culture, skateboarding, parkour, flatland bmx, etc)

F.L.U.X. And Ohm
A long time ago, Ohm was approached by the world’s largest company F.L.U.X* and was offered help with the infrastructure of their city. Ohm was scheduled to be provided the first of its kind, billions of dollars worth of cutting edge technology not yet seen anywhere else. 
This of course, was a marketing ploy - the company was quickly losing credibility for a recent slip up, and needed a way to regain traction from consumers as soon as possible. Through many board meetings, they concluded that helping out Ohm was almost foolproof. The perfect plan.
But as upgrades were about to be completed, and during a street festival, the city’s teenagers came onto construction sites and deliberately ruined all that was built, to the point of no repair, 
With this, F.L.U.X. were at crossroads. There was no more room for mistakes. They lost almost everything, and Ohm was just another dead cause. 
And since F.L.U.X. was still under the close and suspicious gaze of the media, the company had to play everything out as calm, collected and professional as possible. 
Through clenched teeth, all was forgiven, but since then the company has held a big vendetta against Ohm. 
Updates were promised to be rescheduled, but there has been no signs of reconstruction for decades (almost 5!)
Despite being at fault though, Ohm has since then forgotten all that’s happened. (Other than old news archives at the library)








Prologue: 
There is an incoming and spreading pandemic heading for the city, and F.L.U.X, still as big as ever, has cruelly voted amongst themselves on providing supplies everywhere except Ohm, and that all media broadcasted in Ohm should not mention the event
Other cities are not notified of this discrimination, and are put into lockdown. Ohm stays the same. 
Contrary to the occasional rumour, the people of Ohm seem unfazed and continue with their daily lives. However, the main character John* has been told by his uncle, that things are not as they seem. 
John jokingly brushes off the warning, as his uncle was always a bit cryptic, but understood that there was always some meaning behind the man’s words. 
One night, John is invited out by his uncle to get dinner together.
But, instead of the usual family restaurant, John is sent an unknown address from his uncle, that leads him to a dark alley*, far from the city. 
In the alley, there stands a figure waiting. As John approaches, the man swiftly comes to hug John. “Call me as soon as you get home. I’m sorry.”
John catches a glimpse of the man walking away, and based by the familiar build and voice, identifies him as his uncle. 
Confused and hungry, John heads on home, but picks up some dinner on the way back. He assumes that maybe his uncle was just busy that night. 
John forgets to call his uncle, but sends him a message apologizing for not contacting him right away. No reply. 
The next night, John gets ready to go out. He can’t seem to find his VR headset* and so, he rummages through piles of clothes in hopes to find it. Amidst the chaos, he hears a soft thud as something flies out of his jacket pocket
A severed [motherboard, a memory chip, and a note]* lie on the floor. John is puzzled for a second, but realizes he’s late, so doesn’t give the items a second thought
Not even a few days later, John’s uncle is murdered in cold blood.


# Q&A Time! 

But why Ohm? 
Ohm is very well liked, and is well known around the world for its strong influence on entertainment - kind of like how Japanese culture is in the west. 
It’s a city with a rich history and lots of cool old buildings still intact, the perfect tourist attraction. 
Ohm fashion also has quite a large impact globally.
If F.L.U.X. actually completed all of its upgrades, theoretically, profits would have skyrocketed and the amount they spent on construction would have been paid back almost 10 folds! According to their analytics expert, (lovingly called) graph guy. 
(He got fired) 



Why did those darn teenagers trash everything?
It seems they didn’t appreciate the sudden change, and held sentimental value to the places that were torn down. 
Actually there were a number of protests held against construction even before it began, but alas, their voices fell on deaf ears. 


On F.L.U.X.’s accident:
Long story short, one small slip up led to thousands of casualties, ranging from nausea and intense flu like symptoms to the [emergence of strange, uncharacteristic behaviour, hostility and death]* - patients of this caliber were briefly stolen away in the night, and any trace of them gone forever. 
A vague the coverup was given to the family

On the virus:
John later figures out that it’s a man made pathogen 






























# Characters:

John*
> Character trope - Troubled edgelord?
Main character
Since he was a small child, he was under his uncle’s care - though his uncle was not always there (especially when John needed him) 
Now, he currently lives in his own place
Has adapted himself to be able to form relationships with other people (he has a pretty extensive group of friends), but still keeps his distance emotionally 
When he feels he’s most vulnerable, and at his most weakest point, does not seek counsel with anyone, simply because he was not taught to (and it was not demonstrated to him either as a child) otherwise. He doesn’t understand why he feels the way he does (when this happens) and seeks ways to distract himself 
Not aware that he uses these things as escapism
One of his favourite distractions  pastimes is skateboarding and making music
The other is inviting women he meets to his home - though, despite this, John is unable to form a proper romantic connection with another person
Though, despite his uncle not being around as much as a child John respects the man very much, and he is his only family

Rose*
> Character trope - Quirky companion (and John’s obvious character foil?*)
Has a strong sense of justice and a tendency to stick her nose into places she doesn’t belong. 
Just as curious as John when it comes to the murder
John and Rose’s meeting was pure coincidence
Cheerful, witty, “humble” know-it-all, can be sarcastic

Rose’s cat (wearing a small mech suit)
> Character trope - Side character irrelevant to the main plot but still everyone’s favourite 
Doesn’t care
Fat
Mech suit too elaborate for a cat

John’s uncle, David*:
> Character trope - Over-glorified dead guy
Model citizen
Well known and loved in Ohm for selling mood enhancing robo plants* (can’t think of anything better)
Lived a double life (John doesn’t know this) 
An employee and lead biochemist at F.L.U.X.
Was working on a drug, that was allegedly supposed to help with immunity against the virus 
All his research was stolen when he was murdered


Suspect #1 - Dave’s “ex,” Julie*:
> Character trope - Undercover delusional obsessed lady you see on Dr.Phil 
Known for stalking, but she doesn’t see it as stalking
A seemingly normal lady.
Very intelligent and a savant (in her field) but is also an airhead, and forgetful when it comes to herself and what she’s doing.  
Ex F.L.U.X. employee (doesn’t even remember) now runs her own little body and mech enhancement shop. 
Dave is her trigger word. She gets a little (very?) crazy when she hears someone say Dave
Claims to have dated him and that he loves her very much
Despite her weird behaviour, Dave still treated her as he would everyone else. Though, he rejected all of her advancements.
She has a tattoo on her body by instruction of her psychiatrist. It’s a safeword to say when she gets too deep into her illusions. (Weird words welcome)
Julie thinks she got the tattoo drunk one night
Safeword has to be said before a certain threshold (within 17.231 seconds), otherwise the success rate decreases every 10 seconds, divided by 2 each time.
At this point, someone needs to shoot her her with a massive tranquilizer needle
 Julie has not always had mental issues, but it was a result from a motorcycle accident. 
At the time Dave and Julie were somewhat involved romantically (but it was a casual relationship) 
Was mostly working on a top secret project together for F.L.U.X.
Dave was driving the motorcycle, but due to some technical complications was not able to stop the bike, or steer properly. 
Luckily(?) though, they were thrown into the water (from a medium-low-ish bridge)* and were also wearing helmets
Dave was able to come out relatively unscathed, save for a few fractures, but Julie hit her head hard.
In the hospital, they stayed in different rooms, but their recovery went almost flawlessly 
Dave recovered the fastest, and one day decided to visit Julie a few days before she got discharged
Julie sees Dave and goes into a fit, screaming, body gesticulating, and with eyes Dave has never seen before. She is strapped down, and Dave is curtly shown his way out. 
It seems the head injury caused Julie a bit of brain damage and the creation of key memories that acted as new motivations and ambitions for her
She believed that she worked as a slave, and that during his travels, Dave saved her from a distant town, and granted her a new life in Ohm
She felt she had to repay him with her life. 
While in slavery, she heard of a man named Dave that went around doing good deeds, and so during work, imagined a perfect life together with him
Professionals tried to return her old memories, or at erase her new ones, but to no avail
Other than that, she is classified as no threat to other civilians
She has an assistant in her shop - who is actually a care aid in disguise (hired by her health professional) - that makes sure Julie takes her medicine
Why is she a suspect? Even though Dave showed no resentment towards her, he also made it clear he had no interest in her. One could speculate that one night, she forgot to take her meds, and in that state broke into Dave’s home, and tried to seduce him. But out of rejection killed him in a manic fit of anger.

Suspect #2 - Dave’s neighbour and old “friend,” Tom*: 
> Character trope: Childhood friend and next level friendzoned creep 
Childhood friends with Dave and Julie (all hung out as children)
Loved Julie since they were kids
Actually saw Dave at a friend at one point but his anxiety grew towards him as they got older
Although they still remained friends, his nervousness warped into anger and rage when Dave was unable to keep Julie safe
His hatred for himself for entrusting Dave with Julie grew even moreso. 
From then on he stopped caring about the morals and ambitions he treasured so much
As a kid, he declared he wanted to be a famous public authority that kept the streets safe* (needs a name), and told Julie that he would protect her no matter what
The accident wrecked his mental state
As a form of escapism, he uses his VR system* to simulate old and new memories of him and Julie as a child
Artist
In his house, underneath a giant tarp, are a bunch of portraits of Julie in different poses 
Monitored Dave’s everyday routine via GPS, small camera and wiretap, and wrote it down in a notebook. (stalking)
Has boxes and boxes of these notebooks
Has been charged with a number of felonies already (think of a cyberpunk justice system?) 
Known to solicit young girls that remind him of Julie* (maybe going too far)
 Why is he a suspect? 
He’s Dave’s neighbour, and so travel time and a getaway method is not difficult to arrange. 
He’s also familiar with Dave’s schedule, so he has an idea of what he’s doing at what time.
Hatred for Dave and twisted love for Julie. 


Suspect #3 - Dave’s business’ competition, Jack*: 
> Character trope - Always second place and “of course he has a depressing backstory”
Hates Dave with a passion
Even with Dave gone, people are still talking about Dave’s store 
Reckless spender
Always tried to one up Dave but failed miserably
Has resorted to writing a blog online on how much Dave annoys him, and has a growing hate shrine
Why is he a suspect? Dave allegedly “stole” one of his greatest ideas, which resulted in Dave gaining more popularity, press, and praise. 
This in turn gave made Jack:
Jealous (“That should’ve been me”)
Worsened his paranoia (feeling like everyone is looking down on him/comparing him)
Kinda poor with difficult living circumstances
Develop an unhealthy Dave obsession - to finally rise above him in all aspects of life (superiority complex?)
Has had a difficult past, and even worse had a perfectionist, controlling mother and an abusive and substance addicted father. Never felt he was good enough, and didn’t have any friends.* 
Now he is cunning and charismatic (in his own strange way), but still creepy as heck 
How could Jack have done it? (With evidence and info collected from story) 
One could speculate, that once Jack closed shop after a particularly bad day, he noticed Dave still working. 
With a million self deprecating voices resounding in his head; customers, his mom and dad, close friends and even Dave himself, Jack has had enough. 
Jack has had nightmares of a particularly traumatizing event ever since he was a child, that happened between him, his father and his mother when he was younger. 
He’s not sure if it actually happened, or a memory he made up
But as he realizes one’s around, he suddenly, like second nature, is playing the whole thing out as he enters Dave’s store. 
Everything is a blur, but he feels like the resolution is coming very soon - his usual fear replaced with out of place and twisted satisfaction
But instead of a small, beaten and broken child, everything ends with a panting disheveled Jack, a wrecked store, and a very, very dead Dave. 
Jack panics, cleans everything up, drives to Dave’s house, and makes it seem like he was murdered in his own home instead - and in the process creates his own alibi.   
(End speculation?)

So whodunnit?:
