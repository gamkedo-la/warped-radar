## Characters:

#John - Player
Since he was a small child, he was under his uncle’s care - though his uncle was not always there (especially when John needed him) 
Now, he currently lives in his own place
Has adapted himself to be able to form relationships with other people (he has a pretty extensive group of friends), but still keeps his distance emotionally 
When he feels he’s most vulnerable, and at his most weakest point, does not seek counsel with anyone, simply because he was not taught to (and it was not demonstrated to him either as a child) otherwise. He doesn’t understand why he feels the way he does (when this happens) and seeks ways to distract himself 
Not aware that he uses these things as escapism
One of his favourite distractions  pastimes is skateboarding and making music
The other is inviting women he meets to his home - though, despite this, John is unable to form a proper romantic connection with another person
Though, despite his uncle not being around as much as a child John respects the man very much, and he is his only family
